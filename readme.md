# Auto Video Label (AVL)
A system that labels the picked target and generates corresponding bounding boxes.

## Purpose Behind AVL
As machine learning become more dominant in the computer vision field, the need of labelling system rises.
Conventionally, human forces have to spend time labelling the images once the data has been collected.
It could be very tiring from time to time ...
